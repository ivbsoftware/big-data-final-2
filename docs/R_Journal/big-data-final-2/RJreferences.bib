	abstract = {Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.The first algorithm for random decision forests was created by Tin Kam Ho using the random subspace method, which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the "stochastic discrimination" approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg.An extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, and "Random Forests" is their trademark. The extension combines Breiman's "bagging" idea and random selection of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance.},

Chloride analysis was carried out by Laboratório de Bebidas                        de Origem Vegetal do Espírito Santo (Labeves), using the                    potentiometric method, in which the dosing is directly applied to the sample                    with an Ag/AgCl electrode. Data were collected to establish the level of                    chloride, as presented in the analysis reports issued by Labeves, and to serve                    as a wine categorization database, according to grape variety and country of                    origin. Australia and Argentina presented the highest levels of chloride and the                    wines made from the Syrah variety presented the highest concentration of such                    ion. We have, therefore, found that terroir and grape variety                    do have an influence over the concentration of chloride in red wines.Key words: salinity; chloride; wine characterization},

From these data the rejection levels of the compounds, when present in musts, were established for both red and white table wines. Grapes molded with a number of fungi were fermented and the rejection levels for ethyl acetate verified. These must rejection levels for ethyl acetate in white and red grapes were 60 and 115 mg/l respectively. For acetic acid in white and red musts the rejection levels were 1190 and 900 mg/l respectively.},
